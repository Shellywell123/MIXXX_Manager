# Mixx Manager

Making a Dj rig using linux and Mixxx, annoyed to see the navigation of trackis is not folder based as have all mine in nice genre folders.
So made a small python script to set the genre meta data of each song to be the folder name which it belongs to. So that I can now sort my tracks by genre on Mixxx. :)
